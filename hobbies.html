    <h2><span title="Attack on Titan">•┈••✦ Shingeki no Kyojin ✦••┈•</span></h2>
    <h4 style="text-align: justify;"></h4>
    I love the story of <strong>Attack on Titan</strong> because it’s incredibly gripping and full of surprises. The show creates an immersive world where humanity is fighting for survival against terrifying Titans, with constant mysteries and secrets that make the story even more intriguing. The characters are deeply complex, each one facing their own struggles and growth, which makes it easy to connect with them. What keeps me hooked is the unpredictability of the plot, where every episode brings new twists and revelations. It's not just about the battle between humans and Titans, but about uncovering dark truths and dealing with the consequences of those revelations. The themes of freedom, sacrifice, and the devastating effects of war are explored in such a way that it constantly raises questions about the price of freedom and whether humanity can escape the cycles of violence they find themselves trapped in.
    What I love most about Attack on Titan is how it explores both the darkest parts of human nature and the light of hope and resilience. It doesn’t shy away from the harsh realities of the world, but it also shows the strength of the human spirit in the face of overwhelming odds. The show continuously challenges my expectations, keeping me emotionally invested in the characters and their journey. Each episode leaves me thinking deeply about the choices the characters make, the cost of war, and what it truly means to be free. The story is a perfect balance of intense action, thought-provoking themes, and powerful moments of human connection.

    <h2 align="left"> •┈••✦ ROUGH BY GFRIEND •┈••✦ </h2>
    <p>The ballad version of <i>Rough</i> by <strong><i>GFRIEND</i></strong> feels so emotional to me because of how the song is slowed down and sung softly. This really makes the feelings in the song stand out more. The lyrics talk about the struggles and challenges people face, especially when you're young and trying to figure out life. It's about feeling lost but still trying to reach your dreams, even though it's tough.</p>
    <p>When the song becomes a ballad, the softer music makes the sadness and hope in the lyrics feel even stronger. It’s like reflecting on the past and wishing things were easier, but still holding on to hope. The slow pace and the way the singers sing it make the song feel more personal and deep. For me, it really connects because it talks about how we all feel uncertain or struggle at times, but we keep going, hoping for better things.</p>
