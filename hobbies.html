                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    I love the story of <strong>Attack on Titan</strong> because itâ€™s incredibly gripping and full of surprises. The show creates an immersive world 
                    where humanity is fighting for survival against terrifying Titans, with constant mysteries and secrets that make the story even more intriguing. 
                    The characters are deeply complex, each one facing their own struggles and growth, which makes it easy to connect with them. What keeps me hooked 
                    is the unpredictability of the plot, where every episode brings new twists and revelations. It's not just about the battle between humans and Titans, 
                    but about uncovering dark truths and dealing with the consequences of those revelations. The themes of freedom, sacrifice, and the devastating effects 
                    of war are explored in such a way that it constantly raises questions about the price of freedom and whether humanity can escape the cycles of violence 
                    they find themselves trapped in.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    What I love most about Attack on Titan is how it explores both the darkest parts of human nature and the light of hope and resilience. It doesnâ€™t shy 
                    away from the harsh realities of the world, but it also shows the strength of the human spirit in the face of overwhelming odds. The show continuously 
                    challenges my expectations, keeping me emotionally invested in the characters and their journey. Each episode leaves me thinking deeply about the choices 
                    the characters make, the cost of war, and what it truly means to be free. The story is a perfect balance of intense action, thought-provoking themes, and 
                    powerful moments of human connection.

            <p>
                In my opinion, the saddest moment in Attack on Titan is when Mikasa is forced to kill someone she loves in order to end the war. This scene is 
                heartbreaking because it shows how war can tear people apart and make them do unimaginable things. Mikasa, who has always been so close to Eren, 
                has to make the ultimate sacrifice for the greater good. Watching her struggle with this decision really hit me because it shows how deeply war 
                affects everyone, even the ones we care about the most. The emotional pain Mikasa feels is so real, and it makes me think about the high cost of 
                peace and the difficult choices that sometimes have to be made to end violence. For me, this is the most sorrowful and tragic moment in the whole series.

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            I love the story of <strong>Detective Conan</strong> because it combines intricate mysteries with interesting characters. Each case presents a challenge
             that tests the limits of logic and reasoning, while the main character, Conan, uses his detective skills to solve them. The show not only focuses on 
             crime-solving but also dives into the personal struggles of the characters, making them more relatable. What keeps me hooked is the gradual unraveling 
             of the overarching mystery, while still enjoying the standalone cases in every episode. <br>
             What keeps me hooked, though, is the gradual unfolding of the overarching mystery. While each episode offers standalone cases that are satisfying to 
             watch, thereâ€™s an underlying narrative that keeps pulling me back for more. Itâ€™s this combination of self-contained mysteries and the larger, ongoing 
             story arc that makes Detective Conan such a captivating series in my eyes. Every detail feels purposeful, and the anticipation of discovering the 
             bigger picture makes the journey even more exciting. <br>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            I think <strong>Taxi Driver</strong> is one of the best K-dramas because of its exciting and meaningful story. Itâ€™s not just about action or revenge; 
            it shows how victims who were wronged by society get justice. The way Kim Do-gi and his team take on different cases is both thrilling and emotional. 
            Each episode tells a new story, and I love how it focuses on real-life issues like bullying or scams. Watching them fight for people who canâ€™t fight for 
            themselves feels satisfying and inspiring.<br> 
            What makes it even better, in my opinion, is the strong teamwork and character development. The Rainbow Taxi team works like a family, and their bond 
            adds a lot of heart to the drama. I also love how the show keeps you thinking about what is right and wrong. Itâ€™s not just a simple revenge storyâ€”it makes
            you question justice and morality in a creative way. Plus, the acting and action scenes are top-notch, which keeps me hooked from start to finish.<br>

        <p>
            This scene is very sad because it shows how even the strongest characters can feel weak. I feel sad watching it because Kim Do-gi, who is usually 
            strong, seems so vulnerable in this moment. Itâ€™s hard to see him struggle emotionally when heâ€™s always been so tough. This part reminds me that 
            even strong people can feel pain and weakness sometimes. Itâ€™s really emotional to see him like this.

                into their worlds and create new scenarios that I feel could have happened but werenâ€™t shown. Writing fanfic is a way for me to take the characters I connect 
                with and give them a new direction, adding my own ideas and emotions. It's a fun way to express my creativity and imagine stories that I never get to see in 
                the original material. Ultimately, itâ€™s an escape where I can create my own adventures, make the characters mine, and experiment with new possibilities.

                I enjoy editing as a hobby because it allows me to bring ideas to life in a way that feels creative and fulfilling. For example, when I edit posters, 
                I love experimenting with layouts, colors, and fonts to ensure the design is visually appealing and effectively communicates the message. Similarly, 
                editing K-pop-themed content, like fan edits or graphics, lets me combine my passion for music and creativity by highlighting my favorite idols or 
                moments in unique ways. Itâ€™s not just about fixing errors; itâ€™s about enhancing the impact of a story, design, or project. Whether itâ€™s tweaking a 
                poster for better clarity or adding effects to a K-pop edit, I find joy in the process of turning something good into something unforgettable.

                The ballad version of Rough by GFRIEND feels so emotional to me because of how the song is slowed down and sung softly. This really makes the 
                feelings in the song stand out more. The lyrics talk about the struggles and challenges people face, especially when you're young and trying to figure
                out life. It's about feeling lost but still trying to reach your dreams, even though it's tough. <br> When the song becomes a ballad, the softer music makes
                the sadness and hope in the lyrics feel even stronger. Itâ€™s like reflecting on the past and wishing things were easier, but still holding on to hope. 
                The slow pace and the way the singers sing it make the song feel more personal and deep. For me, it really connects because it talks about how we all 
                feel uncertain or struggle at times, but we keep going, hoping for better things.

                My favorite song from Attack on Titan is Akumanoko by Ai Higuchi because it perfectly captures the deep emotions and struggles of the characters. 
                The songâ€™s haunting melody and heartfelt lyrics really connect with the themes of survival and freedom in the anime. Ai Higuchiâ€™s emotional voice 
                makes the song even more powerful, and it fits the animeâ€™s intense atmosphere.<br>
                What makes Akumanoko so special is how it matches the emotional journey of the characters. The mix of traditional and modern sounds adds a unique
                touch, making the song memorable. Every time I hear it, it reminds me of the characters' battles and growth, making it feel even more meaningful.

                In my opinion, Imaginary Friend by ITZY is a sad song because it talks about feeling lonely and having no one to turn to. The lyrics make me feel 
                like the person is trying to hold on to something or someone that isnâ€™t really there, which is really heartbreaking. Itâ€™s sad to think about how 
                the person is struggling with their emotions and trying to find comfort in an imaginary friend. The song makes me reflect on how difficult it can 
                be when you feel alone, even when youâ€™re surrounded by people. It really touches my heart and makes me think about the pain of not being able to 
                connect with others.
