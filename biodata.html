    <p><b>: ̗̀➛ ABOUT ME:</b><br> 
            My name is <strong>Nur Ismahani binti Ahmad Remi</strong> but I am commonly known as <strong>Isma</strong>. I was born at <strong>Hospital Besar Ipoh, Perak</strong> <i>(September 16, 2004)</i>, and I am now <strong>20 Years old</strong>.<br>
            I am the <strong>eldest</strong> of three siblings, with my younger siblings aged 17 and 12. Being a part of such a loving and close-knit family has shaped who I am today, teaching me the values of <i>responsibility, patience, and care.</i></p>
            
    <p><b>: ̗̀➛ MY PERSONALITY:</b><br>
            I would describe myself as a self-disciplined and resourceful problem-solver. My self-discipline allows me to stay focused on my goals, manage my time effectively, and consistently work towards achieving my objectives. Whether it's juggling assignments or preparing for exams, I prioritize my tasks and maintain a strong work ethic.</p>
        
    <p><b>: ̗̀➛ EDUCATION (DIPLOMA):</b><br>
            I'm studying at <strong>Universiti Teknologi MARA(UiTM) Rembau</strong> in <em>Diploma Information Management</em> (<abbr title="Pengajian Sains Maklumat, Kolej Pengkomputeran, Informatik dan Matematik">PSM, KPPIM</abbr>).<br>
            For your information, I have always wanted to study architecture because it is my passion. Unfortunately, I didn’t get into the architecture course I wanted. Instead, I decided to pursue a Diploma in Information Management. For my degree, I think I would love to continue in content management, since it combines my interests in technology, communication, and creativity.</p>
            
        
    <p><b>: ̗̀➛ FAMILY:</b><br>
            I am the <strong>eldest</strong> of three siblings, with my younger siblings aged 17 and 12. Currently, my family and I live in <strong>Nilai, Negeri Sembilan</strong>, a quiet, peaceful area that offers both a sense of community and the tranquility of suburban life.</p>
