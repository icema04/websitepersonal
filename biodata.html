            My name is <i>Nur Ismahani binti Ahmad Remi</i> but I am commonly known as <font color="#fff0f5">Isma</font>. I was born at 
            <strong>Hospital Besar Ipoh, Perak</strong> <i>(September 16, 2004)</i>, and I am now <strong>20 Years old</strong>.
            I am the <font color="#fff0f5"> eldest </font> of three siblings, with my younger siblings aged 17 and 12. Being a part of such a loving 
            and close-knit family has shaped who I am today, teaching me the values of <i>responsibility, patience, and care.</i>
            <br>
            I would describe myself as a self-disciplined and resourceful problem-solver. My self-discipline allows me to stay focused on my goals, 
            manage my time effectively, and consistently work towards achieving my objectives. Whether it's juggling assignments or preparing for exams, 
            I prioritize my tasks and maintain a strong work ethic.
            <br>
            I strive to maintain a healthy balance between my academic, personal, and social life. While I work hard to meet my goals, I also recognize 
            the importance of taking time for myself and nurturing the relationships that matter most. My experiences so far have taught me that growth 
            is not only about achieving success but also about learning from setbacks and continuing to move forward with resilience.

            I'm studying at <strong>Universiti Teknologi MARA(UiTM) Rembau</strong> in <em>Diploma Information Management</em> 
            (<abbr title="Pengajian Sains Maklumat, Kolej Pengkomputeran, Informatik dan Matematik">PSM, KPPIM</abbr>).
            For your information, I have always wanted to study architecture because it is my passion. Unfortunately, I didnâ€™t get into the architecture 
            course I wanted. Instead, I decided to pursue a Diploma in Information Management. For my degree, I think I would love to continue in content 
            management, since it combines my interests in technology, communication, and creativity.

        <!--About internship-->
        <h3 style="color: #f1c6d0; text-shadow: 4px 3px 5px black; margin-left: 150px;">ð“†©â™¡ð“†ª WORK EXPERIENCE ð“†©â™¡ð“†ª</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: large; width: 80%; margin: 0 auto;">
            During my internship at the <strong>Unit Hal Ehwal Islam (UHEI) at Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM)</strong>, I gained valuable experience in various office tasks 
            and learned a lot about administrative work. My main duties included creating and editing posters, managing official letters, and shredding documents. 
            I also helped prepare reports for programs and drafted meeting minutes, which helped me improve my writing and organizational skills. Working at UHEI 
            taught me how to be more responsible and detail-oriented in handling tasks. I was also able to develop my communication skills as I worked closely with 
            my colleagues and supervisors. This internship was a great opportunity for me to understand the importance of office work and how it supports the smooth 
            running of an organization. Overall, my time at UHEI was a positive learning experience that allowed me to grow both personally and professionally.<br>
            However, if I were to recommend this place for students at UiTM to intern, I would say it might not be the best choice. This is because the internship 
            took place during the semester break, and as a result, there were fewer students around, and fewer programs took place.
            This meant there were fewer opportunities for hands-on learning and interaction with students. However, during regular times when students return from 
            semester breaks, the situation changes. UHEI is involved in a lot of activities, and interns have the chance to participate in various programs, events, 
            and projects. The office is busier, and interns would have more opportunities to engage in meaningful tasks. Therefore, if a student from outside UiTM
             were to intern here, I would definitely recommend it, as they would have a fuller experience during the active periods.
