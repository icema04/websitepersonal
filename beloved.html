            <h3> MY PARENT </h3>
            <p>
                My parents are the most important people in my life. They have always been there for me, no matter what. When I feel lost or scared, 
                they are the first to comfort me with their kind words and warm hugs. They work so hard every day to make sure our family has everything
                we need, even if it means sacrificing their own happiness. My parents have taught me the true meaning of love, strength, and patience. 
                I admire their wisdom and the way they always put others before themselves. Every moment with them reminds me how lucky I am to have their
                support and love. I hope one day I can make them proud and give back even a little of what they have given me.<br>
                Both my parents are nearing their 50s, so I feel a strong responsibility to take care of them and be there for them. Even though I’m not someone
                who openly shows my feelings, I have my own way of expressing how much I care. It may not always be obvious, but in my own quiet way, I try 
                to show my gratitude and love for everything they have done. My goal is to continue supporting them and making their lives easier, even if it's 
                in small ways. I want them to know that no matter what, I will always be there for them, just as they have always been there for me.

             <h3>About My Siblings</h3>
             <p>My siblings are my lifelong companions. They are the ones I can always count on for laughter, advice, and support. We may argue sometimes, 
                but they are the ones who truly understand me. Growing up together has created a bond that I treasure deeply, and I feel lucky to have them by my side. 
                As the eldest child in the family, I always feel responsible for them. No matter what happens, I try my best to guide and support them in any way I can
                because I care about them so much.<br>
                My younger sister, Nur Umairah, is currently preparing for her SPM this year. She has been working very hard to reach her goals, and I am really proud 
                of her efforts. Meanwhile, my little brother, Azhad Firas, is about to finish primary school and will soon start secondary school. Seeing them grow up 
                and achieve new things makes me so happy. I hope they will continue to do their best in everything they do, and I will always be here to support them
                through every step of their journey.</p>

             <h3>About My Friends</h3>
             <p>My friends are like a second family to me. They bring so much joy and positivity into my life. Whether we are laughing together or supporting
                 each other through tough times, I know they will always be there for me. I truly cherish the memories we create and the strong bond we share. 
                 These friendships mean a lot to me because they make my life happier and remind me that I am never alone. Having friends like them makes everything 
                 better, and I feel lucky to have such amazing people by my side. 
                 <br>These two friends, Nur Umairah and Nur Farhana, have been my closest companions 
                 since primary and secondary school. We have always been together, and even after all these years, we remain very close. I often call Umairah by her 
                 nickname, Umai, or sometimes Yuyu. Farhana, on the other hand, I usually call Yeon because of her obsession with Yeonjun. 
                 They both have their own special qualities, and I rely on them in different ways. Although I have more than just these two best friends, 
                 Umai and Yeon are the ones I am closest to until now. They have been with me through so many moments in life, and I am truly grateful to
                  have friends like them who understand me so well..</p>
